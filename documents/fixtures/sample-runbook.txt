Incident runbook: RAG ingestion pipeline

Scope:
- Small fixture corpus stored in documents/fixtures
- Pipeline writes chunks to the PGVector database configured via RAG_DATABASE_URL

Steps:
1) Confirm prerequisites
   - Environment variables: RAG_DATABASE_URL, QWEN_API_KEY
   - Optional: RAG_SOURCE_DIRS set to documents/fixtures
2) Run the ingestion CLI
   - Command: uv run python -m src.rag_pipeline.cli --output-format text
3) Validate
   - Check CLI summary for chunk counts per file
   - Spot-check that the database contains new chunks tied to source paths

Rollbacks:
- If ingestion fails, clear partial rows for the fixture files from the chunks table.
- Re-run the ingestion once credentials or connectivity issues are resolved.
