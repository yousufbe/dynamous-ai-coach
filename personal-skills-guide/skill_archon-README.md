# Claude Code Skills - Complete Guide

Welcome to the Claude Code Skills showcase! This project provides a hands-on introduction to **Claude Code Skills** - a powerful way to extend Claude's capabilities with your own custom workflows and expertise.

## Featured: Archon as a Claude Skill

**Archon** - a knowledge base and task management system for AI coding assistants - as the primary example of Claude Skills in action. Archon traditionally operates as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, but this implementation demonstrates how you can **transform any API-based tool into a token-efficient Claude skill**.

**The Power of Skills Over MCP:** While MCP servers are powerful for connecting Claude to external systems, they consume thousands of tokens per server at session start. Skills take a different approach - they use only **dozens of tokens for metadata**, loading full content only when needed. The Archon skill in `.claude/skills/archon/` shows how you can interact directly with REST API endpoints (the same ones the MCP server uses) without the overhead of the MCP protocol wrapper.

**What's Inside:** The Archon skill includes a complete Python client (`scripts/archon_client.py`), full API documentation (`references/api_reference.md`), and interactive setup flows - all demonstrating production-ready patterns for building skills that leverage existing APIs. Whether you're working with knowledge search, project management, or document indexing, this skill shows how to make those capabilities available to Claude with maximum efficiency and minimal token overhead.

This makes Archon both the **centerpiece example** and a **practical tool** you can use immediately. The rest of this guide explains the broader skills ecosystem, but Archon demonstrates the real-world impact: turning heavyweight integrations into lightweight, context-aware capabilities.

## Prerequisites

To use the Archon skill demonstrated in this repository, you need to have **Archon installed and running** on your system. Archon is a separate application that provides the knowledge base and task management backend.

**Install Archon:**
- Repository: [github.com/coleam00/Archon](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon)
- Follow the installation instructions in the Archon repository
- Ensure Archon is running before using the skill with Claude Code

## Quick Start: Using the Archon Skill

This repository includes a ready-to-use Archon skill in `.claude/skills/archon/`. To use it in your own projects:

**Copy the skill to your project:**

```bash
# From your project root directory
cp -r /path/to/claude-skill-archon/.claude/skills/archon .claude/skills/
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# From your project root directory
Copy-Item -Recurse C:\path\to\claude-skill-archon\.claude\skills\archon .claude\skills\
```

The skill will automatically be available in Claude Code and will guide you through connecting to your Archon instance on first use.

## What Are Claude Code Skills?

**Skills** are modular capabilities that extend Claude Code's functionality. Think of them as specialized "expertise modules" that teach Claude how to handle specific tasks or workflows.

### Key Characteristics

- **Model-Invoked**: Claude automatically decides when to use a skill based on context (unlike slash commands which you manually trigger). This mentioned, if not doing automatically, just mention the usage of skill xyz.
- **Modular**: Each skill is a self-contained folder with instructions and resources
- **Shareable**: Skills can be shared via git with your team or community
- **Composable**: Multiple skills can work together to handle complex tasks

### Real-World Analogy

If Claude Code is a smart assistant, **Skills** are like specialized training manuals that teach the assistant new capabilities:
- A "PDF Extraction" skill teaches Claude how to parse and extract data from PDFs
- An "API Scraper" skill teaches Claude how to fetch and process web data
- A "Test Automation" skill teaches Claude your preferred testing patterns

---

## Why Use Skills?

### 1. **Reduce Repetitive Prompting**
Instead of explaining the same workflow every time, encode it once as a skill.

**Without Skills:**
```
You: "Please extract the data from this PDF, format it as JSON, and validate the fields..."
(Repeat this explanation every time you work with PDFs)
```

**With Skills:**
```
You: "Process this PDF file"
Claude: (Automatically activates pdf-extractor skill and follows your predefined workflow)
```

### 2. **Share Team Expertise**
Capture your team's best practices and workflows in skills that everyone can use.

**Example:** Your team's testing conventions, code generation templates, or API integration patterns.

### 3. **Extend Claude's Capabilities**
Add specialized knowledge that Claude doesn't have by default.

**Examples:**
- Company-specific workflows
- Domain-specific data processing
- Custom code generation patterns
- Integration with proprietary tools

### 4. **Compose Complex Workflows**
Combine multiple skills to handle sophisticated tasks.

**Example:** Use `api-scraper` to fetch data, `data-processor` to transform it, and `report-generator` to create output.

---

## How Skills Work

### Model-Invoked Behavior

Skills are **automatically activated** by Claude based on the context of your request. You don't need to explicitly call them (though you can reference them if needed).

**How Claude Decides:**
1. You make a request: "Extract tables from this PDF"
2. Claude reads all available skill descriptions
3. Claude finds `pdf-extractor` skill has a description mentioning "PDF" and "tables"
4. Claude activates the skill and follows its instructions

### Skill Activation Flow

```
User Request → Claude Analyzes Context → Matches Skill Description → Activates Skill → Follows Instructions
```

### Progressive Disclosure

Claude reads the main `SKILL.md` file initially, but only loads additional resources (templates, examples, scripts) when needed. This keeps context efficient.

![Progressive Context Loading](assets/image.png)
*Source: [Dani Avila on X](https://x.com/dani_avila7/status/1981394535155438029)*

**How progressive loading works:**

1. **Main Context** - Always loaded: Your project's CLAUDE.md and basic context
2. **Skill Discovery** - When you make a request, Claude scans all skill descriptions to find matches
3. **Skill Activation** - Once a skill is selected, Claude loads it in three stages:
   - **SKILL.md** - Always loaded immediately when the skill activates
   - **Referenced files** - Loaded only when needed (examples.md, reference.md, etc.)
   - **Supporting files** - NOT pre-loaded; accessed directly when executed (scripts, templates)

This progressive approach means skills can include extensive resources without overwhelming Claude's context window.

## Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill is a **directory** containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter.

### Minimal Skill Structure

```
my-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

### Complete Skill Structure

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Required: Main skill file with frontmatter and instructions
├── examples.md        # Optional: Example usage and outputs
├── reference.md       # Optional: Additional documentation
├── templates/         # Optional: Template files
│   └── template.txt
└── scripts/           # Optional: Helper scripts
    └── helper.py
```

### SKILL.md Format

Every `SKILL.md` must start with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it. Include trigger keywords.
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob  # Optional: restrict which tools Claude can use
---

# Skill Instructions

Your detailed instructions go here in markdown format.

## What This Skill Does

Explain the skill's purpose and capabilities.

## When to Use

Explain the scenarios where this skill should be activated.

## Instructions

Step-by-step instructions for Claude to follow.

## Examples

Show example inputs and expected outputs.
```

### YAML Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Format | Description |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `name` | ✅ Yes | lowercase-with-hyphens | Unique identifier (max 64 chars) |
| `description` | ✅ Yes | Plain text | What the skill does + when to use it (max 1024 chars) |
| `allowed-tools` | ❌ No | Comma-separated list | Restrict which tools Claude can use when skill is active |

### Writing Effective Descriptions

The `description` field is **critical** - it's how Claude determines when to activate your skill.

**Good Description (Specific):**
```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill PDF forms, and merge PDF documents. Use when the user mentions PDFs, forms, document extraction, or table parsing.
```

**Bad Description (Too Generic):**
```yaml
description: Helps with documents
```

**Tips:**
- Include the **what** (what does it do?)
- Include the **when** (trigger keywords)
- Be specific about capabilities
- Mention file types, use cases, or domain terms

---

## Project vs Personal Skills

Skills can be stored in **two locations**, each with different purposes:

### Project Skills: `.claude/skills/`

**Location:** `.claude/skills/my-skill/` (in your project repository)

**Purpose:** Team-shared skills that are version-controlled with your project

**Use When:**
- Building team workflows
- Sharing best practices across your organization
- Creating project-specific conventions
- Skills that should be available to all team members

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automatically available to all team members
- ✅ Version controlled via git
- ✅ Shared across the entire team
- ✅ Changes can be reviewed via pull requests

**Example:**
```bash
my-project/
├── .claude/
│   └── skills/
│       ├── company-api-client/   # How to interact with company APIs
│       ├── test-patterns/        # Team's testing conventions
│       └── code-standards/       # Code generation templates
└── src/
```

### Personal Skills: `~/.claude/skills/`

**Location:** `~/.claude/skills/my-skill/` (in your home directory)

**Purpose:** Individual workflows available across all your projects

**Use When:**
- Personal productivity workflows
- Experimental skills you're testing
- Skills specific to your work style
- Tools you use across many projects

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Available in every project you work on

**Example:**
```bash
~/.claude/
└── skills/
    ├── my-commit-style/      # Personal git commit conventions
    ├── my-code-review/       # Personal code review checklist
    └── my-documentation/     # Personal doc writing style
```

### Which Should I Use?

| Scenario | Location | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Team coding standards | Project | Everyone should follow the same standards |
| Your personal git commit style | Personal | Individual preference |
| Company API integration patterns | Project | Shared knowledge for all developers |
