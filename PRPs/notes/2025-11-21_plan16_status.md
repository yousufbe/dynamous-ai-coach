# Plan 16 Execution Status — 2025-11-21

Execution log for `PRPs/requests/16-next_steps_execution.md`.

- Archon is now reachable at `http://localhost:8181`; created tasks Plan16-1..7 under project `fbe94a2b-1226-4e38-b094-f3a66cdedbb2` and moved them to review with notes. Task 2 remains blocked pending Langfuse API keys.
- Validation rerun: `.venv/bin/ruff check src` ✅, `.venv/bin/mypy src` ✅, `.venv/bin/pytest tests -v` ✅ (48 passed, 1 skipped performance). PyTorch still warns about the unsupported GTX 1060 (GPU1); mitigation remains `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`.
- Langfuse: `~/local-ai-packaged/.env` now seeds a project `Local Dev` with keys `pk-lf-0lBMFVNpEA-e-z3zPGPZ5g` / `sk-lf-eaWk_ujfXWuUvNoW_EdH8dilPdLv1nvII0jLQznDU1g`, ENCRYPTION_KEY fixed to 64-hex, and Redis auth aligned (`requirepass LOCALONLYREDIS`). Smoke via `build_tracer` writes spans to ClickHouse (`traces` table) with correlation-id-derived trace_ids.
- Implementation state: Langfuse env stubs and docs exist (`.env.example`, README, architecture/validation docs); GPU masking/warnings implemented in `src/shared/device.py` with doc guidance; performance benchmark remains opt-in via `RUN_PERFORMANCE=1`; frontend docs point at the FastAPI backend by default. `src/shared/tracing.py` now uses the Langfuse 3.x OTLP API with a SpanProtocol adapter.
- Next steps: use the seeded keys for `/chat` tracing; optionally rerun performance with `RUN_PERFORMANCE=1` and refresh `docs/post_ingestion_validation.md` if results change.
